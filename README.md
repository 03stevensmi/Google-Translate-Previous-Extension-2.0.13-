# Google-Translate-Previous-Extension-2.0.13-
This is the Last Working Google Translate Chrome Extension That Works With Brave etc. 
DO NOT EVER DOWNLOAD THE UPDATED VERSION!! 
IF YOU HAVE, UNINSTALL IT NOW & REPORT THE DEVELOPER IMMEDIATELY !! 


This is the official version rescued and archived by Henry Poole! 
Special thanks to him. 
Please give all credit for his amazing work. 


Also, just in case you have googled a solution to find an old version of this extention... 
yeah, Dont download anything from crx4chrome, its fake. 
When extracted, its not a chrome extention, 
but a .com exe that i would put money on that it's a virus. 


Here is the tutorial for installing this extention: https://youtu.be/fjP08B_E80


But in short,

Unzip the file,

Go to extention setting on browser,

Enable developer mode,

Click load unpacked,

Open up the folder inside,

Select & Done!

Enjoy!
