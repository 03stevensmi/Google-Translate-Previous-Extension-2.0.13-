# Google-Translate-Previous-Extension-2.0.13-
This is the Last Working Google Translate Chrome Extension That Works With Brave etc. 
DO NOT EVER DOWNLOAD THE UPDATED VERSION!! 
IF YOU HAVE, UNINSTALL IT NOW & REPORT THE DEVELOPER IMMEDIATELY !! 


This is the official version rescued and archived by Henry Poole! 
Special thanks to him. 
Please give all credit for his amazing work. 


Also, just in case you have googled a solution to find an old version of this extention... 
yeah, Dont download anything from crx4chrome, its fake. 
When extracted, its not a chrome extention, 
but a .com exe that i would put money on that it's a virus. 

- ==PLEASE READ!==

- UPDATE:
- I HAVE CHANGED THE VERSION NUMBER IN THE "manifest.json" FILE FROM VERSION 2.0.13 TO 999992.0.13!
THIS WILL FIX THE PLUGIN FROM AUTOMATICALLY UPDATING!
YOU CAN FIND THE CHANGES TO THIS PLUGIN IN THE "NO-AUTO-UPDATES" BRANCH!
PLEASE USE THE UPDATED ZIP FILE IN THE RELEASES PAGE TO FIX AUTO UPDATES!
FOLLOW THE NEW TUTORIAL BELOW!

A short and simple tutorial:

- Remove the translate plugin from chrome

- Download the NEW .zip file Called:
  "Google Translate Chrome 2.0.13 (NO AUTO UPDATE).zip"
  from the releases page here:
  https://github.com/03stevensmi/Google-Translate-Previous-Extension-2.0.13-/releases/

- Extract the zip file

- Go to the Manage Extentions setting on browser

- Enable developer mode

- Stay On That Page, Then Drag and drop that New Folder Named: "DRAG THIS FOLDER TO MY EXTENTIONS" to the Browser!

Done!

Hope This Has Helped You Guys!
